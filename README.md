# LED Sequence README

## Description

This code controls three LEDs connected to digital pins 10, 9, and 8 respectively on an Arduino board. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- `int LED1 = 10;`, `int LED2 = 9;`, `int LED3 = 8;`: Declares variables to represent the pin numbers for three LEDs.

- `void setup() {...}`: The setup function runs once when the microcontroller starts. In this function:
  - `Serial.begin(9600);`: Initializes serial communication at a baud rate of 9600.
  - `pinMode(LED1, OUTPUT);`, `pinMode(LED2, OUTPUT);`, `pinMode(LED3, OUTPUT);`: Configures the specified pins as output pins for controlling the LEDs.
  - `digitalWrite(LED1, LOW);`, `digitalWrite(LED2, LOW);`, `digitalWrite(LED3, LOW);`: Sets the initial state of the LEDs to LOW, turning them off.

- `void loop() {...}`: The loop function runs repeatedly as long as the microcontroller is powered. In this function:
  - Turns on LED1 for 2 seconds, then turns it off for a short delay.
  - Turns on LED2 for 500 milliseconds, then turns it off for a short delay.
  - Turns on LED3 for 2 seconds, then turns it off for a short delay.
  - This sequence repeats indefinitely.

## Analysis

1. There are some syntax errors in the code:
   - `pinMode(LED1, Output);` should be `pinMode(LED1, OUTPUT);`.
   - `digitalWrite(LED1, LOw);` should be `digitalWrite(LED1, LOW);`.
   - Similar corrections are needed for LED2 and LED3.

2. The LED sequence appears to be designed to have LED1 and LED3 stay on for longer periods compared to LED2, creating a visual sequence with varying durations.
